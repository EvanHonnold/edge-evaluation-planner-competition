# Planner Competition 1: Edge Evaluation
A fun way to compare planners that operate in an environment constrained by edge evaluation.

Inspired by "A Unifying Formalism for Shortest Path Problems with Expensive Edge Evaluations via Lazy Best-First Search over Paths with Edge Selectors" (Dellin and Srinivasa, 2016).
